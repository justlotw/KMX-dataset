Given that the total number of books is the sum of the books on the top and bottom shelves, we have B + (B + 4) = total number of books.

Since there are a total of 2 shelves and there is one shelf with B books and another with B + 4 books, the total number of books must be distributed equally on both shelves.

This means that the total number of books must be divisible by 2. Therefore, the total number of books on both shelves must be an even number.

From this, we can infer that the number of books on the bottom shelf, B, must be an even number so that B + 4 is also an even number.

Substitute L in terms of W into the formula for the area: Area = L x W = (12 - W) x W = 12W - W^2. To find the maximum area, we will find the derivative of the area with respect to W. 

Taking the derivative of the area function, we get: d(Area)/dW = 12 - 2W. Setting this derivative equal to 0 to find the critical points: 12 - 2W = 0. Solving for W, we get W = 6.

A brand of cereal had 1.2 milligrams (mg) of iron per serving. Then they changed their recipe so they had 1.8mg of iron per serving. What was the percent increase in iron?,50,"The percent increase in iron content can be calculated using the formula:

Percent Increase = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) x 100%

In this case, the old value of iron content was 1.2 mg and the new value was 1.8 mg. 

Thus, Percent Increase = ((1.8 - 1.2) / 1.2) x 100% = 0.6 / 1.2 x 100% = 0.5 x 100% = 50%

Therefore, the percent increase in iron content is 50%.",7th grade,Rates and percentages,Percent word problems,markup_and_commission_word_problems,rates-and-percentages,Word Problem,True,train

Total cost = 2.10*x + 5

Given that Ann paid a total of 49.10, we have:

Floyd is an aspiring music artist. He has a record contract that pays him a base rate of 200 a month and an additional 12 for each album that he sells. Last month he earned a total of 644. Write an equation to determine the number of albums (a) Floyd sold last month. Find the number of albums Floyd sold last month.,37,"Let's denote the number of albums Floyd sold last month as a.

"Rewrite as a simplified fraction. 3.5, where 5 is recurring  = ?",((32)/(9)),"To rewrite 3.5, where 5 is recurring, as a simplified fraction, we can represent the recurring decimal as an infinite geometric series. This can be expressed as follows:
