Peter scored 15 goals during his second soccer season as a forward. He scored 6 fewer goals during his first season. The team as a whole scored 4 times as many goals as Peter during the two seasons. How many goals did the team score during the two seasons?,96,"Let's denote the number of goals Peter scored in his first season as x.

Subtracting the fraction of votes received by Johnson from the fraction of votes received by Dragovic:
(1/2) - (1/9) = (9/18) - (2/18) = (7/18)
